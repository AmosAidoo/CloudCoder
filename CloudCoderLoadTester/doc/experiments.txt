  Result:             worked fine?

  Result:             some connection timeouts initially;
                      clean run after adding random delay prior to login
                      (see below)
  Notes:              modified load LoadTesterTask/PlayEditSequence to add a
                      0-10 second random delay prior to login (to avoid a
                      thundering herd situation), and to retry all RPC
                      operations (up to 3 attempts total)

  Time to completion: 1008 seconds
  Result:             clean run
  Notes:              CPU utilization around 40% (bursting to 50%): workload on
                      webapp/MySQL enough to saturate one CPU core.  From running
                      top, the webapp and MySQL seem to be consuming CPU about
                      equally.  The build server is quite heavily loaded (close
                      to 100% CPU utilization); should try experiment using
                      multiple build servers.

  Result:             clean run
  Notes:              Multiple build servers are definitely helpful

  Time to completion: 618
  Result:             clean run
  Notes:              Very slow to start up, java (webapp) process consuming near 100%
                      of CPU.  Are we triggering the bug where Jetty runs poorly on
                      EC2?  Upgrade to more recent version of Jetty?
                      During the run CPU utilization is more reasonable.
                      Interestingly, mysql CPU utilization remains fairly low.

  Result:             clean run
  Notes:              CPU utilization by the webapp (not mysql!)
                      is extremely high in the startup phase.  Need to investigate.
                      Perhaps some of it is the requests for the Javascript code
                      and other static resources?
