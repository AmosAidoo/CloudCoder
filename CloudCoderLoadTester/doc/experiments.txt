Load testing experiments

  Mix:                skip3
  Num threads:        117
  Max pause (ms):     5000
  Webapp server:      lobsang (3-core AMD, 8GB RAM)
  MySQL:              local, local filesystem
  Builder:            8-core AMD, 32GB RAM (YCP CS cluster head node)
  Time to completion: 508 seconds
  Result:             worked fine?

  Result:             some connection timeouts initially;
                      clean run after adding random delay prior to login
                      (see below)
  Notes:              modified load LoadTesterTask/PlayEditSequence to add a
                      0-10 second random delay prior to login (to avoid a
                      thundering herd situation), and to retry all RPC
                      operations (up to 3 attempts total)

  Result:             clean run
  Notes:              CPU utilization around 40% (bursting to 50%): workload on
                      webapp/MySQL enough to saturate one CPU core.  From running
                      top, the webapp and MySQL seem to be consuming CPU about
                      equally.  The build server is quite heavily loaded (close
                      to 100% CPU utilization); should try experiment using
                      multiple build servers.
